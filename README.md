# CoderDojo notes

This project is essentially the wiki for CoderDojo Stirling. It contains useful information for running our dojos.

If you're a mentor, then feel free to make changes. You'll need to be a member of the [CoderDojoStirling](https://github.com/CoderDojoStirling) github organisation. Just give Greg your github username, and he'll add you.
